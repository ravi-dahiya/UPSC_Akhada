            <h4> About the Programme</h4>
              <p>
              Previous Year Questions (PYQs)are the gold standard in UPSC preparation. From trend to themes, they provide us knowledge 
              about UPSC's thought process for that paper. In psychology also, PYQs are the yardstick to check one's preparation level. 
              In my 2 years mentorship experience, it is one of the most demanding aspect. Aspirants want to write PYQs, get them 
              evaluated and need modal answers for the same. However, there is a vacuum in this aspect. To fill this void, we decided to
              launch PYQ PARISHARAM. </p>
